The purpose of this module is to implement a prediction market in Drupal.  The
prediction market features a 'market maker', a facility to automatically
conduct trades with users based on algorithmically-determined prices.  This
ensures that the market remains liquid at all times and that users can always
conduct trades, subject to having the necessary funds.
